# Handling data

We unpacked the test.csv and train.csv to the Data-folder, but the files are too big to share so we have .gitignored them and loaded them individually.
We have also done one change to the train.csv data to make it load in numpy:
Using notepad++ we changed s to 0 and b to 1 so every number is an float.

    s = 0
    b = 1
